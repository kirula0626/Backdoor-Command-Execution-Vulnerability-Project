# Backdoor-Command-Execution-Vulnerability-Project
This paper describes my first research experience in creating an undetectable backdoor to the Metaspotibale operating system, using an open-source software tool such as the Metasploit framework, Nmap. In our project, we created a fully undetectable backdoor using Kali Linux operating system. This attack was successful because this machine used an old version of the vsftpd service. And this version of vsftpd had a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to compromise.
